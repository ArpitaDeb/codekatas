In this kata we are going to write a program for reversing numbers in binary in the most eficient way. 
For instance, the binary representation of 10 is 1010, and reversing it gives 0101, which corresponds to number 5.
The input will be 10 and the output will be 5.

Input: number betwwen 1 and 1000000000

Output: number
