In this game we asume we are involved in a melee combat between two opponent heroes: player1 and player2.
Every hero has an attack value and a defense value.
The attack is resolved as follows: 
player1 (attacker) throws two eight-sided dice and add their attack value.
If this total value exceed (not equalize) the player2's defense value, player1's attack sucess.
There are two more things to take into account:
player1 can boost their attack throwing an extra eight-sized die (this attack throws now 3 eight-sided dice)
player2 can boost their defense adding +2 to the original defense value.

Create a function to calculate the percentage of success of a player1's attack in this tabletop combat game.
