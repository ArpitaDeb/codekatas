This kata consist on the implementation of a given function that returns an array with that quantity of perfects numbers

What's a perfect number? Info here: https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%BAmero_perfecto

For example, if the function receives the param 3, it should return:
[6, 28, 496]

Additional score will be given to those implementations with better efficiency.
Additional score will be given to those implementations that can return a high amount of
perfect number (7ยบ one is 137438691328, so I don't think every algorythm can handle it)
