Given the server code and the available architectures of the image, there is going to be multiple requests to this API:

- (POST /authenticate + username + password) authenticate with user and password and return back a token 
- (GET /users/me + token) returns the name of the user the token is associated with.

The code works in the architecture A. 

Say if a 200, 401 or 500 status codes are possible in architectures B and C, and propose a way to avoid 401 or 500 status codes. 

To make it simpler, suppose this:
 - Each web instance has a single execution thread (i.e. only one request processed at a time and the others wait patiently in a queue without failing).
 - Machines never fail due to external factors, they are always available, their services are working and we never reboot them.
 - The function that generates tokens randomly always generates different tokens.
 - The system load won't be high enough so that the system goes down, though there could be multiple incoming requests almost at the same time.
 - The data in the requests are always valid, i.e. the username and password are always in the database, and the token used in /users/me is one of the already authenticated ones.
 - The log file always exists in the filesystem, has write permissions and we don't consider it to be very big or the hard drive not big enough.
 - The communication between the different elements in the architecture works.
