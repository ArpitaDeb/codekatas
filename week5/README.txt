The purpose of this data is to refactor the function renderSchedule included to make it more readable and scalable.

The function of renderSchedule is to use an external class that render schedules to draw a schedule table with the columns
for all the days, colour the work days in grey and the weekend in yellow, and fill in each of the column with the stored
data for each one of the days.

This functionality must not be changed, and the communication with external classes must be done using the same 
methods.
